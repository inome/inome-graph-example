#Inome Graph Example
The [inome graph example](http://developer.inome.com/GraphExample) was created to show what is possible with the inome APIs and provide examples of it's usage.
It uses our in-house [graph library] (https://github.com/inome/inome-graph-example/blob/master/javascripts/graphlib.js) built on top of [d3](http://d3js.org) to show a graph-based visualiztion of what is
returned from the inome api.
